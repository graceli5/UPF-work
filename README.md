# UPF-work

Work for UPF skynote internship 2024 summer, including notebooks with machine learning modeling that can be run in the future with new data.

Notebook 1: Respiration_posture_upf
Exploring the accuracy with which models can predict the pitch/note one is singing at by analyzing their facial position in video data.

Notebook 2: note_face_upf
Researching whether it is possible to predict when a participant is singing using correct or poor posture using only respiration sensor data.
